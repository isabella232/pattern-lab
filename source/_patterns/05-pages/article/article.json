  "article_body": "<p>For the past fifteen years, chef Mina Stone has been an integral part of the art world's dining table. Stone, who initially began cooking for artists to support her work in fashion, eventually focused on cooking full-time, and now frequently makes beautiful meals for artists' openings and studios, including the likes of Elizabeth Peyton, Urs Fischer, and many others. <ol><li><b>Congestion Pricing:</b> In a truly historic moment for New York City’s transit riders, and after many years of advocacy, Albany finally passed congestion pricing in New York State’s FY2020 budget. Congestion pricing is expected to raise tens of billions of dollars in much needed new revenue to fund transit capital projects and will go into effect in 2021.</li><li><b>Fast Forward:</b> In 2018, New York City Transit released its highly ambitious plan to repair and modernize transit service, a plan which was well received by transit riders and advocates alike. The plan includes efforts to resignal New York City’s subway system on an expedited timeline, redesign the city’s outdated bus network, and overhaul subway station accessibility by equipping 70 additional subway stations with elevators and ramps.</li><li><b>Fair Fares:</b> A historic win for low-income New Yorkers, New York City is now funding half-priced MetroCards for low-income New Yorkers. The full program will be open for enrollment in 2020, with almost 100,000 eligible New Yorkers already enrolled in the program.</li><li><b>On-Demand Access-A-Ride:</b> In 2017, the MTA launched a revolutionary pilot program to a small number of Access-A-Riders that provided on-demand, single trip service. This pilot has been largely considered “life changing” by those who have used it due to its flexibility and easy scheduling, allowing riders to book single trips whenever they need to travel. The fate of the pilot, however, can be found on our “Top Ten Worst of the Decade” list.&nbsp;</li><li><b>14th Street Busway:</b> Until recently, buses along 14th Street in Manhattan crawled along so slowly that the Straphangers Campaign “awarded” the M14A with the <a href=\"https://www.nypirg.org/pubs/201907/Straphangers%20Campaign%20Pokey%20Awards%202019.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2019 Pokey Award</a> for New York City’s slowest bus, moving at an average speed of 4.3MPH. In October, the City implemented a busway along 14th Street, giving street priority to the tens of thousands of bus riders who take M14A/D buses each day and vastly improving travel speed and ridership numbers on both routes.</li><li><b>BusTime:</b> In 2011, the MTA launched BusTime, allowing riders to track the location of their bus in real-time. Not only has BusTime proved a useful tool for riders to find out when their bus will arrive, but it has provided riders and advocates alike with new data to better analyze how bus service is performing throughout the five boroughs.</li><li><b>2nd Avenue Subway Opens:</b> &nbsp;Some 90 years after it was first recommended, the Second Avenue subway opened its first three stations on January 1, 2017.</li><li><b>NYC’s Better Buses Action Plan:</b> New York City released its plan to expand street priority for buses and improve New York City bus speeds, the slowest in the country, 25% by the end of 2020.</li><li><b>Pre-Tax Transit Benefits:</b> New York City now requires businesses of 20 or more to offer employees the option of participating in a federal pre-tax program, saving subway, bus, and commuter rail riders potentially hundreds of dollars in commuting costs each year.</li><li><b>  “It’s OMNY Time”:</b> The MTA is moving forward with updating its fare payment technology by replacing the now-outdated MetroCard with OMNY, a tap-and-go payment system. OMNY is currently available at a number of stations throughout the boroughs, as well as on Staten Island express and local buses.</li></ol> This April, the chef will open an eponymous restaurant <a href=\"http://press.moma.org/news/mina-stone-to-open-new-restaurant-at-moma-ps1/\">at MoMA PS1</a>, called Mina's, replacing the M. <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/tags/mwellsdinette\">Wells Dinette</a> that's been the museum's in-house eatery since 2012.</p><div class=\"c-article__related c-article__related--small-screens\"> <div class=\"c-related-content u-spacing u-border-accent u-border-accent--left\"> <h3 class=\"c-related-content__heading u-font--secondary-style u-font--xs\">Related</h3> <ul class=\"c-related-content__list u-spacing\"> <li><a href=\"\" class=\"u-has-accent u-has-accent--secondary u-font--s\">Urban Organics Wants to Fix Food</a></li><li><a href=\"\" class=\"u-has-accent u-has-accent--secondary u-font--s\">The Best Cycling Gear We Tested This Year</a></li><li><a href=\"\" class=\"u-has-accent u-has-accent--secondary u-font--s\">The Biomechatronic Man</a></li></ul></div></div><p>M.

Stone told Gothamist that she conceptualized the menu with artist Alex Eagleton, who, in addition to designing the space, is particularly adept at making meats and braises. The initial menu features the likes of whipped feta, beet, toasted cumin seed, and cilantro sandwiches, and greens seasoned with mint, toasted sesame seeds, and a yogurt dressing. The menu will also have a rotating daily special, which ranges from toasted pine nut, lemon zest, and parmesan orzo to braised chicken with cinnamon and clove.</p><div class=\"o-ad o-ad--300x250\"><img src=\"https://s0.2mdn.net/8766144/CWDisplayAds_OutsideHPTO_300x250.jpg\" alt=\"\"><span class=\"o-ad__label u-font--secondary-style u-font--xs u-color--gray\">Advertisement</span></div><p>While Stone describes the physical space's design as \"a little Miami beach, a little Greek island, and a little New York,\" the idea is more or less an extension of her 2015 book Cooking For Artists, which brims with her no-fuss takes on Greek fried eggs, saffron rice, and beet fritters. \"I wrote a cookbook and I cater for a living, but I’m a home cook at heart,\" she says. \"So it’s important to me that my food always reflects that.\" Part of that involves recipes and techniques that she learned from her Yiayia, her Greek grandmother.</p><h2>Embedded Image</h2><figure class=\"o-figure\"><div class=\"o-figure__image\"><img src=\"http://gothamist.com/attachments/nyc_pmejia/22119mina3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div><figcaption class=\"o-caption\"><p><span class=\"o-icon o-icon--dashed-arrow u-icon--s\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 30 30\"><title>Dashed Arrow Icon</title><polygon points=\"18.74 3.12 29.96 14 18.74 24.88 18.74 16.72 15 16.72 15 11.28 18.74 11.28 18.74 3.12\"/><rect x=\"8.2\" y=\"11.28\" width=\"5.44\" height=\"5.44\"/><rect x=\"4.12\" y=\"11.28\" width=\"2.72\" height=\"5.44\"/><rect x=\"0.04\" y=\"11.28\" width=\"2.72\" height=\"5.44\"/></svg></span>Stone and her Yiayia poring over 'Cooking for Artists.' <span class=\"o-credit\">Photo by Alex Eagleton</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Stone says the appeal of opening Mina's at PS1 stemmed from the unique challenge that comes with operating a cafe at a museum, as well as catering events that take place there.\"I’m used to the way I do things now, and I want to get to get out of that box and do things differently for like, 30,000 people in a weekend,\" she told us, adding: \"How do you feed so many people and make it delicious, and make the right kind of food for feeding lots of people?\"</p><p><em><a href=\"https://momaps1.org/\">MoMA PS1</a> is located at 22-25 Jackson Ave, Long Island City, Queens.</em></p>",
