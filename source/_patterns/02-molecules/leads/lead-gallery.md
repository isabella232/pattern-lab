A gallery lead asset is a molecule that is displayed at the top of an article, above the body in the lead asset position, and also uses the first image in the gallery as the primary image for the article (unless overridden in the CMS).
### Interactions:
1. Clicking/tapping on the 1st image will open the gallery overlay
1. Clicking/tapping on 2nd or 3rd image will display those images in the 1st position
1. View All opens the gallery overlay
